# codequiz
4th homework assignment for coding bootcamp

THe task was to develop a code quiz using html, css and javascript. THe quiz is to be timed and there should be a time penalty for getting a question incorrect. Once completed, you should be able to save your scores.

I considered using different methods and began by creating a initial page that welcomes the user to the quiz with a button to begin the quiz. Using javascript this page is then removed and a new page appears that was initially hidden using CSS.

I tried numerous methods to create the quiz questions, some of which have now been commented out as they were determined to be inefficient. I decided on arrays which contained objects with the questions display in buttons.

Once one question is answered then the next question is shown on screen.

Once all questions are answered or the time runs out. A final screen is shown.
